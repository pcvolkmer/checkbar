== Usage

You should create a configuration file `.checkbar.toml` in your home directory, e.g.

----
# Update interval in seconds. Default value if not set is 60 sec.
interval = 60

# Time format (optional), defaults to "%R" (= "%H:%M)"
time_format = "%H:%M:%S" # = "%T"

[[checks]]
name = "Host 1"
url = "https://host1.example.com"

[[checks]]
name = "Host 2"
url = "https://host2.example.com"

[[checks]]
name = "App 1"
url = "https://app.example.com/actuator/health"
check_type = "Actuator"

[[checks]]
name = "App 2"
url = "tcp://app.example.com:12345"
check_type = "Tcp"
----

The value for `interval` can be set by using plain seconds or using units. Accepted units:

* h, hour, hours
* m, min, mins, minute, minutes
* s, sec, secs, second, seconds

Unparseable values will default to 60 seconds.

----
# Update interval using seconds as number.
interval = 60

# or ...

# Update interval using value with units.
interval = "2m 30s"
----

The value for `time_format` is used to set the time format to be shown. It defaults to `%R`.
For available options, see: https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html

Each host or application to be checked consists of `name` and `url`.

You can optionally specify `check_type`:

* `Html`: Default value, checks if a request is successful and returns HTTP OK - 200.
* `Actuator`: Like `Html`, but checks if _Actuator_ shows that the application is up and running.
  ** `Up`: Actuator response indicates, application is up and running.
  ** `Warn`: Got response, but it is not Actuator health `UP` response or redirect.
  ** `Down`: No response.
* `Tcp`: Checks if TCP connection to given host and port can be established

To use more than one configuration, pass the config file location to be used as first argument to the application.

=== Colors

To change the colors, use the following configuration. As an example, the colors of the default configuration are shown.

----
...
[colors]
up = "#00FF00"
warn = "#FFFF00"
down = "#FF0000"
...
----

The color configuration is optional. If used, all colors must be specified.

Colors are not available if running in terminal mode.

=== Execute commands

You can also specify a command to be executed when a mouse click occurs on a checked host.
Use `click_cmd` to specify the command to be executed, e.g.

This is not available if running in terminal mode.

----
...
[[checks]]
name = "Host 1"
url = "http://host1.example.com"
click_cmd = "xterm -e ssh admin@host1.example.com"
...
